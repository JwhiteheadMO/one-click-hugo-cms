blurb:
    heading: Why Kaldi?
    text: "Church.law helps churches meet their everyday legal obligations. We hope you'll sign up below, so that we can update you as we roll out some of these tools starting in late 2017.

Whether you have questions about your church's governing documents, legal duties, intellectual property, or religious liberty, it's important to have the advice of lawyers who understand churches and ministries.

Attorneys Michael Whitehead and Jonathan Whitehead created Church.law to help explain churches to the law, and the law to churches. They have unique experience working with houses of worship and religious ministries. Their clients include nationally-known ministries, including ADF, the ERLC, and the Missouri Baptist Convention. They've represented local congregations in legal matters, at all levels, from trial, through appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

As your church grapples with issues like governing documents, SOGI policies, ministerial housing allowance, and intellectual property, we want to give you the benefit of our experience.

If your legal issue needs custom legal advice, please contact us directly."
